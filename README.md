# Aspect's Bazel helpers library

This is code we would contribute to
[bazel-skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib), but the declared
scope of that project is narrow and it's very difficult to get anyone's
attention to review PRs there.

_Need help?_ This ruleset has support provided by https://aspect.dev.

## Installation

From the release you wish to use:
<https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/releases>
copy the WORKSPACE snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file.
